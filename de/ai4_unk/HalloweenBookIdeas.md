Erstelle einen list of 12 Halloween-themed book ideas targeted at teenagers with a brooding and introspective nature. Consider incorporating elements that would appeal to their interest in darker, more complex narratives. Each book idea should include:

- A compelling and unique title.
- A brief synopsis of the book's plot.
- Key themes and motifs that would appeal to a brooding teenage Zielgruppe.
- The emotional or psychological journey of the main characters.
- The setting of the story and how it contributes to the overall mood.

Stelle sicher that each idea is distinct and provides variety in terms of horror sub-genres, narrative styles, and character development.
